# Zalgo
## _Another API server based on Nodejs, Typescript and native Rust package_

![example workflow](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)


Zalgo is a RESTful app capable to generate and validate Captcha Images embracing twelve factors and cutting edge performances

- Full stricted Typescript code
- Ultra fast image (captcha) generation thanks to Rust native code
- Fine granular configuration of eslint and prettier
- âœ¨ 100% coverage âœ¨

## Features

- Provide two dinsticted API for captcha generation and validation
- Client solutions are accepted for a limited period only
- Client submission are constrained in time and number
- Api doc yaml following 3.0 spec
- A fine graned Dockerfile take care of any aspect of buiding and shipping

The entire lifecycle of request-response is handled by Nodejs app. Image generation (cpu-bound sync task) is executed by calling Rust native code and Node Napi interface thanks to [Neon](https://neon-bindings.com/) project.

> A new captcha image is issued when
> invoking a PUT request. This request
> return a Json that consist of an
> unique `id` and a `base64` string image field
> constrained by an `Expire` header.
> Following requests to Captcha validation are
> now performed by calling a POST api with previous
> uniquie `id` and a `solution` text based field that solve
> previous base64 string image.

## Tech

Zalgo uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [PolkaJS] - A micro web server so fast, it'll make you dance! ðŸ‘¯
- [Nanoid] - awesome web-based text editor
- [Node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Rust] - A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software
- [Neon] - Electrify your Node with the power of Rust!
  [Pino] - ðŸŒ² super fast, all natural json logger ðŸŒ²

And of course Zalgo Captcha itself is open source with a [public repository][zalgo]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Zalgo requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to run.

Install the Nodejs runtime and Rust language following respective documentations. Then to start Rust code compilation, 
install [Neon Cli](https://neon-bindings.com/docs/getting-started#install-the-neon-cli):

```sh
npm install --global neon-cli
# OR
yarn global add neon-cli
```

Now compile Rust with Nodejs bindings:

```sh
cd zalgo-catcha/pkg/zalgo-captcha
npm run compile
```

Install dependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd zalgo-catcha
npm i
LOG_LEVEL=info node run start
```

For production environments (ie: without logging):

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Testing

Once dependencies was installed exececute

```sh
npm run test

```

For coverage:

```sh
npm run test:coverage

```

## Docker

Zalgo is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker container will expose port 3000, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd zalgo-captcha
docker build -t <youruser>/zalgo:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the zalgo image and pull in the necessary dependencies.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 3000 of the host to
port 3000 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --restart=always --name=zalgo <youruser>/zalgo:${package.json.version}
```

## Curl Examples

Verify the server execution by issuing the following command.
```sh
 curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/healthcheck
```

Then ask for a new captcha with
```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:3000/v1/captcha
```

Submit a solution through:
```sh

 curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -vX POST http://localhost:3000/v1/captcha/PupuNxYWZOYrw8ftnoCBu -d '{"solution":"xyz"}'

```
> Note: default captcha liveness is about `2` minutes. After that a new captcha must be generated.

## FE Example

Among this repository is available an example of integration. After starting server you can run this example
from browser tab after spawned a static server, ie:

```sh
cd example
npx static-server

```
